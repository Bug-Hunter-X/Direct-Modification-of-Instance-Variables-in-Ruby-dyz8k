# Direct Modification of Instance Variables in Ruby

This repository demonstrates a common error in Ruby related to modifying instance variables directly and provides a solution.

The `bug.rb` file shows how attempting to directly change an instance variable can lead to unexpected behavior or errors, depending on other parts of the code. The `bugSolution.rb` demonstrates the preferred way of updating instance variables through a dedicated setter method to maintain code structure and avoid potential issues.  This approach enhances the maintainability and predictability of the code.
